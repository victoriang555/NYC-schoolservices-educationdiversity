# PASSNYC School Services

## Description
Based on Kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/passnyc/data-science-for-good.
Goal is to "enable PASSNYC to identify the schools where minority and
underserved students stand to gain the most from services like after school
programs, test preparation, mentoring, or resources for parents". The data has
been dedicated to the public domain.

## Further reading on topic
Below are interesting articles I found around the topic of educational diversity
in NYC schools.
1. "New York City's Flawed School Diversity Plan" http://www.centernyc.org/nyc-flawed-school-diversity-plan
NYC has the following "yardstick goals": Increase by 50,000 the number of
students at "racially representative" schools and reduce the number of
"economically stratified" schools by 10%
